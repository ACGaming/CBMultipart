ForgeMultipart
==============

An API for dynamically handling different functional parts in the one block space.

Requirements:
The latest version of CCC-Public
Forge
scala-compiler.jar (part of a standard scala installation, will need to be moved to /libs/ and linked in your IDE)
A scala compatible IDE and project (For eclipse, download the scala eclipse plugin and right click on the project -> Add Scala Nature)

Implementation of all parts of the API should be clean and easy in Java.
The minecraft multipart mod is implemented in java as a test case.
